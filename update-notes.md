- Added update popups and release-note rendering in the launcher UI.
- Fixed bundled DLL defaults not resetting correctly after launcher updates (auto-repairs missing/stale patcher paths, including Tellurium/auth).
- Increased DLL injection timeout to reduce auth patcher injection failures on some PCs.
